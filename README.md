ABOUT

This mod is dedicated to whoever made the payload feature. For some reason, very few people care about payload at the moment, and I hope that this mod will bolster the awareness of your contribution.

This mod is exactly what it sounds like. It adds a few new units, many of which are based around the payload mechanic. There are also a few turrets and other returning contents that you may recognize if you were one of the few people on the planet that played Unbalance Mod in v5 (if you weren't, that just means you had real mods to play; you didn't miss out on anything).

KNOWN BUGS

Any existing payload weapons in inventories on the field will disarm itself if you load a save. However, if you drop the weapon and pick it up again, it will rearm itself. I currently do not know how to fix this bug, but if you do, please reach out to me.

PLEASE NOTE

This mod is currently in beta (and largely unfinished and unpolished). As such, code, sprites, and balancing will be unstable for now. They will be fixed in the future. As I am currently the only contributor, changes are expected to take a long time.

~~While the mod is technically playable in its current state, you probably shouldn't because it's janky as heck~~

CREDITS

Although I technically created most of the code and sprites myself, I owe the creators of Exotic Mod, Pixelcraft, and Progressed Materials a huge thanks for providing me with sprite and code examples (still working on it).
Unused turret blocks were from Advance Content. I originally planned to use them as placeholders so that I could sprite the turrets before spriting the blocks, but this idea was scrapped, and the blocks remained unused. The blocks were subsequently removed in a later version, but old versions may still have them.

Special thanks to Anuke for creating this game and providing the source code.

And of course, a big thank you for taking the time to play my mod, and goodnight.
