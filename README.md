# TODO

- [X] Purge all sprites from other mods left in for testing purposes

- [X] Remove unnecessary code

- [X] Remove new lines that do nothing

- [X] All missiles and bombs need resprites and cells (but especially t2 and t3 bombs)

- [X] Baseplate needs resprite (this is a v5 weapon sprite for a turret mech but looks too much like a cyclone in turret form)

- [ ] T1, T2, and T3 support units need cells

- [ ] Recolor the support tree to a different shade of green

- [ ] Add weapon sprite for support t4 and resprite support t5's weapon

- [ ] Resprite support t3 and support t5 to not be the same shape as mega and oct (respectively)

- [ ] Add more comments

- [ ] Fix known bugs

This mod is dead, we have killed it
