ABOUT
This mod is dedicated to whoever made the payload feature. For some reason, very few people care about payload at the moment, and I hope that this mod will bolster the awareness of your contribution.

This mod is exactly what it sounds like. It adds a few new units, many of which are based around the payload mechanic. There are also a few turrets and other returning contents that you may recognize if you were one of the few people on the planet that played Unbalance Mod in v5.

KNOWN BUGS
Any existing payload units in inventories on the field will not work anymore if you load a save. However, if you drop the unit and pick it up again, it will rearm itself. I currently do not know how to fix this bug, but if you do, please reach out to me.

PLEASE NOTE
This mod is currently in beta. As such, code, sprites, and balancing will be unstable for now. They will be fixed in the future.

CREDITS
Although I technically created most of the code and sprites myself, I owe the creators of Exotic Mod, Pixelcraft, and Progressed Materials a huge thanks for providing me with sprite and code examples (still working on it).
Special thanks to Anuke for creating this game and providing the source code.

And of course, a big thank you for taking the time to play my mod, and goodnight.
